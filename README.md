# EDA-GDP_Analysis
 
 ### Project Brief
 
 You are working as the chief data scientist at NITI Aayog, reporting to the CEO. The CEO has initiated a project wherein the NITI Aayog will provide top-level recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states, which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.

 The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, you will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.
 
 ### Part-I: GDP Analysis of the Indian States
For each of the following steps of analysis, choose an appropriate type of plot for comparing the data. Also, ensure that the plots are in increasing or decreasing order for better comparison. For example, if you make a bar plot to compare the GDPs of the states, ensure that the bars are in either increasing or decreasing order of GDP.

 

### Part I-A:

- Plot a graph for rows " % Growth over previous year" for all the states (not union territories) whose data is available, use as much data as possible for this exercise. Use the best fit line to represent the growth for each state. Draw a similar line graph for the nation as well.
- How will you compare the growth rates of any two states?
- Which states have been growing consistently fast, and which ones have been struggling? Rank top 3 fastest and 3 slowest-growing states.
- What is the Nation's growth rate?
- What has been the growth rate of your home state, and how does it compare to the national growth rate?
- Plot the total GDP of the states for the year 2015-16:
- Which Plot will you use for this? Why? (Remeber to plot the graph in a way such as it is easier to read and compare)
- Identify the top 5 and the bottom 5 states based on total GDP.

What insights can you draw from this graph? What states are performing poorly? (Remember: this will not be solely based on total GDP)

 

 

### Part I-B:

- Plot the GDP per capita for all the states.
- Identify the top 5 and the bottom 5 states based on the GDP per capita.
- Find the ratio of the highest per capita GDP to the lowest per capita GDP.
- Plot the percentage contribution of the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors as a percentage of the total GDP for all the states.
- Which plot will you use here? Why?
- Why is (Primary + Secondary + Tertiary) not equal to total GDP?
- Can you draw any insight from this? Find correlation of percentile of the state (% of states with lower per capita GDP) and %contribution of Primary sector to total GDP.
- Categorise the states into four groups based on the GDP per capita (C1, C2, C3, C4, where C1 would have the highest per capita GDP and C4, the lowest). The quantile values are (0.20,0.5, 0.85, 1), i.e., the states lying between the 85th and the 100th percentile are in C1; those between the 50th and the 85th percentiles are in C2, and so on.
Note: Categorisation into four groups will simplify the subsequent analysis, as otherwise, comparing the data of all the states would become quite exhaustive.
-For each category (C1, C2, C3, C4):
Find the top 3/4/5 sub-sectors (such as agriculture, forestry and fishing, crops, manufacturing etc., not primary, secondary and tertiary) that contribute to approximately 80% of the GSDP of each category.

Note-I: The nomenclature for this project is as follows: primary, secondary and tertiary are named 'sectors', while agriculture, manufacturing etc. are named 'sub-sectors'.

Note-II: If the top 3 sub-sectors contribute to, say, 79% of the GDP of some category, you can report "These top 3 sub-sectors contribute to approximately 80% of the GDP". This is to simplify the analysis and make the results consumable. (Remember, the CEO has to present the report to the CMs, and CMs have limited time; so, the analysis needs to be sharp and concise.)

-Plot the contribution of the sub-sectors as a percentage of the GSDP of each category.  

 

### Now that you have summarised the data in the form of plots, tables, etc., try to draw non-obvious insights from it. Think about questions such as:

- How does the GDP distribution of the top states (C1) differ from the others?
- Which sub-sectors seem to be correlated with high GDP?
- Which sub-sectors do the various categories need to focus on?
